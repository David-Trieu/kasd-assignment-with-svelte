# kasd-assignment with svelte
I copied the old repo in order to implement svelte. If you want to look at the svelte-part of the project this is the right place to look at. But for the final hapi-part please look at the kasd-assignment repo. If you want to find out what had happened between the time-skip from the kasd-assignment repo, your here correctly. Sorry for the inconvenience it was a missunderstanding of render on my part.
